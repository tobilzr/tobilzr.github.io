        <p class="blog-post-meta">January 23, 2021 by <a href="#">Tobias</a></p>

        <p>It's January 2021 and European small caps have been tremendously successful over the past months (Figure 1).
           In their 2021 global outlook Blackrock recommends "small- and mid-cap U.S. companies as a key place where exposure to
           cyclicality is likely to be rewarded amid a vaccine-led recovery".</p>
           <figure>

                 and Xtrackers MSCI Europe Small Cap ETF (acc). Both time-series start at 100% on Jan 2, 2021.
                 The net asset value (NAV) is closely related to the share price of the ETF.
                 The NAV represents the aggregated asset value of the fund minus any liabilities of the fund per share.

        <p>Wait for a second, that's a lot to digest. What's a small-cap company and why do they beat their larger peers in the recovery from the downturn of early 2020?
          Which role plays "cyclicality" and why is Blackrock emphasizing it? If Blackrock recommends U.S. companies, does the same apply to European companies?</p>
        <h3>Understanding "Small Cap"</h3>
        <p>"Small Cap" - that's industry lingo for small market capitalization ("cap"). The market capitalization of a company is defined by the product of the number of shares outstanding and the current share price. Another name
        is market value or size. To split the companies into groups "large" and "small" we order all the companies by their market value and name the lower half "small" and the upper half "large".
        Index providers, like MSCI, do it slightly differently by summing the market value from the top until the sum reaches 90% of the total. These are the "large" companies, and the remaining 10% are the "small" ones.
        Either way, both approaches typically yield a similar result.</p>
        <p>Fama and French have shown that small companies tend to have greater average returns than large ones. Professionals call this phenomenon the "size-factor" or size "risk-premium". At this point, we leave this by just mentioning it. Such academic results have been averaged over very long periods and therefore have little explanatory power over a tactical timeframe of 6-12 months.
        Furthermore, there's a lively discussion to what degree the size factor is significant.</p>
        <h3>Understanding "Cyclicality" and why Blackrock emphasizes it</h3>
        <p>To understand why Blackrock hints to (U.S.) small caps, we need to understand what "cyclicality" is. Even though we have learned that academic research
        delineates a positive effect of size (or the absence of), small caps won't outperform the market on any occasion. That's where "cyclicality" comes into play. A stock is called cyclical
        if it's "affected by macroeconomic changes, where its returns follow the cycles of an economy". In other words, if the economy is expanding (GDP growth accelerates) cyclical stocks tend to
        outperform the broader market, while they will shower weaker performance if the economy is contracting (GDP growth declines).</p>
        <figure>
           <img src="blog/europesmallcaps/img/smallcaps_cyclical.png" alt="1 Year Trailing Returns">
           <figcaption class="fcaption">Figure 2: We see the trailing 1-year return of the MSCI Europe Index (total return)
              and MSCI Europe Small Cap Index (total return) from 2002 to 2021. Each point on the curves represents the return of the respective index
              over the past 12 months. The grey shaded areas highlight the years in which the eurozone real GDP growth has declined by more than 0.5% in respect to the previous year,
              indicating periods of slowing or declining economic growth. Source: msci.com, eurostat.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In Figure 2, we can exhibit the cyclicality of the European small caps: In the course of the financial crisis of 2008-2009, small caps suffered greater losses than the broader European market.
        In the following economic recovery, however, they've managed to bounce back more strongly. We can observe similar during the European debt crisis in 2011-2012: A greater downturn is followed by a steeper
        recovery. The same pattern repeated itself in 2018-2019, even though the growth phase was abruptly stopped by the coronavirus crisis.  In times of steady economic growth in 2003-2007 and 2013-2017, the small caps outperformed the broader market.
        </p>
        <figure>
           <img src="blog/europesmallcaps/img/gdp_growth.png" alt="Eurozone GDP Growth">
           <figcaption class="fcaption">Figure 3: We see the annual real growth rates of the eurozone gross domestic product (GDP). Here, real growth means nominal growth minus inflation.
             The dashed line marks growth rates that originate from a survey among forecasters, conducted by the ECB. The final rate for 2020 is not known yet, hence we use the 2020 Q4 survey average instead.
            Source: eurostat, ECB.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In Figure 3, we see that forecasters on average, predict a strong rebound of economic growth following the stark contraction in 2020. If our thesis of cyclicality is true, we should see small caps
        relatively stronger in 2021 and 2022. Figure 1 indicates that this trend is already manifesting itself: Small caps have exceeded their pre-coronavirus-crisis level,
        earlier than the broader market.</p>
        <p>Traditionally, cyclicality is explained by the sector to which a stock belongs. In other words, in what kind of business the company is involved.
        Classic examples are airlines, hotels, and restaurants. In times of economic slack, the consumer tends to have less disposable income and thus cuts spending that is not strictly necessary.
        In this example, a worker's family may postpone the summer's holiday in light of fading job security. On the contrary, spending on gas or electricity is difficult to reduce as it serves our basic
        needs. Such stocks are called "defensive."</p>
        <figure>
           <img src="blog/europesmallcaps/img/sector_comp.png" alt="Sector Comparison">
           <figcaption class="fcaption">Figure 4: We see the weight allocation to the different super sectors of the MSCI Europe Index and the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index as of January 21, 2021. The graphic is split into cyclical and defensive sectors
             following the definition outlined in the MSCI Cyclical And Defensive Sectors Indexes Methodology.
            Source: Blackrock iShares, MSCI.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <p>In Figure 4, we can notice some remarkable differences in the sector allocation: Firstly, the weight in Industrials, a cyclical sector, is much higher in the small-cap index. Secondly, the weights for
        Health Care, Energy, and Consumer Staples (defensive sectors) are significantly higher within the broader European market. Overall, the weight of cyclical sectors within the MSCI Europe Small Cap Index is
        66% whereas in the MSCI Europe Index it's only 57%. Thus, <u>we see a tilt towards cyclicality of about 10%</u>. Such a tilt can explain the observed relatively lower returns during economic downturns
        and the relatively higher returns during an economic expansion. However, this insight must be taken with a pinch of salt, since the sector allocation is just a snapshot as of January 2021 and may
        have been different in the past.</p>
        <h3>How to include small caps in your portfolio</h3>
        <p>We have learned that over the long term smaller stocks tend to promise a higher return than the broader market. We also learned that small caps are more cyclical,
        offering relatively more exposure to the economic cycle. Thus, they
        inhibit greater return potential over the next two years, given that we expect a strong economic recovery in 2021 and 2022.
        Now, the question of this section is how to position ourselves to capture the small caps' growth.</p>
        <p>There are many cost-efficient solutions that allow you to simply invest into the European small-cap universe. I'll list a few below:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>Xtrackers MSCI Europe Small Cap UCITS ETF</li>
          <li>iShares EURO STOXX Small UCITS ETF</li>
          <li>iShares STOXX Europe Small 200 UCITS ETF</li>
        </ul>
        <p> To include such ETF in your portfolio we must be aware of the cyclicality. As we have seen, there is greater upside potential, but also a higher risk of losses. Therefore, a tactical approach makes the most sense.
        In other words, instead of "buy and hold", we must carefully capture the cyclicality and manage the risk associated with a possible downturn. Having identified a favorable macroeconomic environment, a suitable approach to manage risk
      is to use the "core-satellite" approach (see Figure 5). While the core typically moves less but captures the broader long-term market trends (e.g. an MSCI World ETF), the satellites can be utilized for riskier and tactical investments.
      The losses of the riskier bets of the portfolio, therefore, are restricted by their lower size. Depended on the risk-appetite, the satellites can take a higher or lower percentage of the total portfolio.</p>
